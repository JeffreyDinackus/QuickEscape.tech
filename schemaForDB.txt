This will be the schema for our MongoDB database:

1. Username/Name of User
2. User Phone Number (know by twilio as "to")
3. Message Body(What we want to send to the user as the quick escape)
4. any kind of authentication from the user?
5. more?

Twilio stuff (may not be necessary to hold in the DB):

account_sid
auth_Token
my twilio phone number from twilio: also know as "from"
