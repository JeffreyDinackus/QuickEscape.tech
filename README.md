# QuickEscape.tech

# The purpose of this app is to get people who are feeling uncomfortable or threatened out of dates by giving them the out of a fake phone call or text message of their choosing. 

# We are going for the main category: Accessability and Empowerment because we are empowering women and men to be free to choose who they go on dates on. Our app lets our users date securely without the pressure of staying, being uncomfortable, or when feeling threatened by offering them a way out. 

# We are going for the sponsorship categories: Best use of MongoDB Atlas, Best use of Twilio, and Best Domain. We use MongoDB Atlas for our database to store our messages to be sent out to our users. We use Twilio for the sending voice and text messages and our app would not be possible without it. We wanted to use a express server but we believe it was blocked by the school wifi so we ended up using MongoDB Data API for our data calls. The features we are using came out in Febuary 2023 and the documentation has not caught up yet. Our domain is QuickEscape.tech, which we registered and we would like to be considered for best domain. 

# Tech stack: React, Twilio(SMS, Voice, and Assets Classic), Tailwind, DaisyUI, MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Data API, Node.js, AWS EC2, Python
