# The purpose of this app is to get people who are feeling uncomfortable or threatened out of dates by giving them the out of a fake phone call or text message of their choosing. 

# We are going for the categories: Accessability and Empowerment because we are empowering women and men to be free to choose who they go on dates on. Our app lets them do this securely without the pressure of staying, being uncomfortable, or when feeling threatened.  

# Tech stack: React, Express.js, Tailwind, DaisyUI, MongoDB Atlas, Node.js, AWS EC2, Python, Twilio
