# The purpose of this app is to get people who are feeling uncomfortable or threatened out of dates by giving them the out of a fake phone call or text message of their choosing. 

# We are going for the main category: Accessability and Empowerment because we are empowering women and men to be free to choose who they go on dates on. Our app lets our users do this securely without the pressure of staying, being uncomfortable, or when feeling threatened. 

# We are going for the sponsorship categories: Best use of MongoDB Atlas, and Best use of Twilio. We use MongoDB Atlas for our database to store our messages to be sent out to our users. We use Twilio for the sending voice and text messages and our app would not be possible without it. 

# Tech stack: React, Express.js, Tailwind, DaisyUI, MongoDB Atlas, Node.js, AWS EC2, Python, Twilio
